A quiz about IT
My goal is to create a quiz with 20 questions on a topic of my choice. Each question must have 4 possible answers with only one of them being correct!
I made use of these programming languages :
html5
css
php
github(to create a repository and commit)
I did a research for possible questions i can use to make a 20 question quiz.
I did some reasearch on some old IT facts that have been around for years
I inserted a image as my background for styling
I used two different google fonts
I used the foreach function for the score for every submit
I used the count++ variable to calculate the correct answers
I also used emoticons to style and attract people
